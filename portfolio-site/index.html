            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a beginner front-end developer. I have always been fascinated by technology and its potential to transform the world we live in. This interest led me to pursue a career in the field of applied technology.
                Before becoming a front-end developer, I spent two years working in customer service. During this time, I developed excellent communication and empathy skills, which I believe are essential for any professional in the tech industry. Additionally, my experience in customer service has taught me how to stay organized and efficient in my work, even when dealing with challenging situations.
                As a front-end developer, I possess a strong aptitude for logical and analytical thinking. I enjoy finding solutions to complex problems and creating intuitive interfaces that are both visually appealing and user-friendly. My current skill set includes proficiency in HTML 5, CSS 3, Figma, Git, and GitHub.
                In 2023, I started my studies in an applied technology bachelor's degree program. This degree will provide me with a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical and practical aspects of technology and equip me with the skills needed to succeed as a developer.
                Overall, I am passionate about technology and committed to improving my skills as a front-end developer. I believe my background in customer service, combined with my logical and analytical thinking, make me an asset to any team. Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!</p>
